# nextjs-github-template

An unopinionated Next.js web template for deploying to GitHub Pages bundling TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS, utilizing atomic design.

## Getting started

You can recreate the repository yourself with the following steps:

1.  Run `npx create-next-app@latest` and push to a new repository.

2.  Install yarn:

    ```bash
    # Enable corepack if not already enabled
    corepack enable

    # Install latest version of yarn
    yarn set version stable
    ```

3.  Add `.yarn` to your `.gitignore` file.

4.  Create `.yarnrc.yml` and paste in the following to disable plug-and-play mode:

    ```yaml
    nodeLinker: node-modules
    ```

5.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn add --dev \
        prettier \
        prettier-plugin-classnames \
        prettier-plugin-jsdoc \
        prettier-plugin-merge \
        prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
    ```

6.  Create `.prettierrc` and paste in the following:

    ```json
    {
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "plugins": [
        "prettier-plugin-classnames",
        "prettier-plugin-jsdoc",
        "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss",
        "prettier-plugin-merge"
      ],
      "endingPosition": "absolute-with-indent"
    }
    ```

7.  Run `npx prettier --write .` to standardize formatting and indentation across all files.

8.  Replace your `nextConfig` with the following. This is not required for deployment since `nextjs.yml` handles static export for us, but it's useful because now you can use `yarn build` to test if static export works before pushing to GitHub.

    ```ts
    const nextConfig = {
      output: "export",
    };
    ```

9.  Replace `yarn start` in `package.json` with `npx serve@latest out` to deploy the static files locally.

10. In GitHub, go to **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source > GitHub Actions** and generate `nextjs.yml` by clicking on the Next.js workflow. Note: if you are using yarn v2 or later, you must edit the YAML file and delete the following lines. This is because the latest version of the `yarn` npm package is v1 while the yarn version specified in `package.json` is higher. You also need to change `npm ci` to `npm install` since `npm ci` requires a `package-lock.json` which does not exist.

    ```bash
    if [ -f "${{ github.workspace }}/yarn.lock" ]; then
        echo "manager=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        echo "command=install" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        echo "runner=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        exit 0
    ```

## Notes

By default, the site is available at the `https://<username>.github.io/nextjs-github-template` subdomain. Images will not load since they do not take the `nextjs-github-template` base path into account. To resolve this for all possible base paths, import the image directly.

```ts
import Image from "next/image";
import vercel_svg from "../../public/vercel.svg";

<Image
  src={vercel_svg} // instead of src="/vercel.svg"
  alt="Vercel Logo"
  className="dark:invert"
  width={100}
  height={24}
  priority
/>;
```

Dynamic routes are only somewhat supported in the Next.js app router with static export. You must generate a list of valid static parameters, and your component must be a server component (not a client component). For example, create `src/app/[userid]/page.tsx` and paste in the following:

```ts
import React from "react";

interface ProfilePageParams {
  params: { userid: string };
}

/** Return a list of `params` to populate the [slug] dynamic segment */
export const generateStaticParams = async () => {
  return [{ userid: "asdf" }];
};

const ProfilePage = ({ params }: ProfilePageParams) => {
  const userid = params.userid as string;

  return <p>Hello {userid}.</p>;
};

export default ProfilePage;
```

## CI/CD

The repository is configured with automatic monthly updates using Dependabot and automatic build testing before each pull request. The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following workflows:

- `nextjs.yml` automatically deploys the website to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.
- `pull_request.yml` runs a sanity check on every opened pull request to make sure the app still builds.
- `dependabot.yml` automatically updates dependencies on a monthly basis. Major updates have individual pull requests while all minor and patch updates are grouped together.
- `dependabot_auto_merge.yml` automatically merges pull requests by Dependabot if it passes the sanity check.

The following GitHub settings are enabled:

- **General > Allow auto-merge**
- **Branches > Branch protection > Require status checks to pass before merging (pull_request_build)**
